# **Sleep Disorder Predictor**

### **Overview**

This project is a machine learning application built to predict the likelihood of the user having a specific sleep disorder, such as Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or no sleep disorder based on various health and lifestyle factors.
The model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier, and the application features a user-friendly GUI using the Tkinter library and allows users to input their data and receive predictions.

### **Main Features**
- Classification: Uses a Decision Tree model to classify the inputs into either one of the categories; insomnia, sleep apnea or no sleep disorder.
- GUI: A simple user interface to allow for user input using Tkinter.

### **Prerequisites**
To run this application, you must have these libraries installed:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter (should come by default with python installation)

`pip install pandas scikit-learn`

Then, 
`python window.py` to run the GUI window. The output should look like this. Next steps are:
- Choose seed value and click 'Train Data'.
- Click 'Test Data' to check the accuracy of the model.
- Enter test data and click 'Make Prediction' to get the classification.
